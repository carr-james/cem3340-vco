== Overview

A Eurorack-format voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) built around the legendary CEM3340 chip.

This module is a faithful recreation of the excellent https://github.com/kassu/kassutronics/tree/master/documentation/VCO%203340[Kassutronics VCO 3340] design.

== Project Structure

This project consists of three PCBs:

* *Front Panel*
* *Control Board* - Front panel controls and input/output jacks
* *Main Board* - Core oscillator circuitry

== Features

* Four waveform outputs: Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, and Pulse
* Coarse and fine frequency control for precise tuning
* PWM control with dual functionality: attenuates external PWM input or directly controls pulse width when unpatched
* Dual exponential V/Oct inputs for accurate pitch tracking
* Linear FM input for frequency modulation
* Switchable hard and soft sync modes

== Specifications

NOTE: Specifications below are based on the original Kassutronics design. Independent testing and verification are planned.

=== Physical

* Width: 8HP
* Panel controls: 1x 20mm knob, 2x 10mm knobs, 1x sub-miniature switch, 9x jacks
* PCB stack: 3 boards (front panel, control board, main board)

=== Power

* Supply voltage: ±12V
* Current draw: ~15mA on both +12V and -12V rails

=== Frequency Control

* Coarse tuning range: 4Hz - 5.3kHz
* Fine tuning range: ±2 semitones
* V/Oct tracking error (10Hz - 10kHz): ±5 cents

=== Outputs

* Waveforms: Triangle, Sawtooth (up ramp), Pulse, Sine
