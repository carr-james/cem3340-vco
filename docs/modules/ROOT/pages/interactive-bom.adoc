= Interactive Bill of Materials

The Interactive BOM (iBOM) is a powerful tool for assembly. It shows the PCB layout with component locations and allows you to highlight specific components as you place them.

TIP: Use the checkboxes to track your assembly progress. The iBOM will highlight component locations on the board.
