# Soldering Tips

Best practices for soldering eurorack modules.

## Equipment

### Essential

- Temperature-controlled soldering iron (recommended)
- Solder (60/40 or 63/37 leaded recommended)
- Flush cutters
- Needle-nose pliers

### Recommended

- Helping hands or PCB holder
- Solder sucker or wick (for mistakes)
- Isopropyl alcohol and brush (for cleaning)
- Magnifier or loupe
- Good lighting

## Soldering Technique

### Temperature

- Lead solder: 300-350°C (575-660°F)
- Lead-free: 350-400°C (660-750°F)

### Process

1. **Tin the tip** - Keep iron tip clean and tinned
2. **Heat the joint** - Touch iron to both pad and component lead
3. **Apply solder** - Feed solder into heated joint (not the iron)
4. **Remove solder first** - Let solder flow, then remove solder wire
5. **Remove iron** - Remove iron and let joint cool naturally
6. **Inspect** - Joint should be shiny and concave

### Good vs Bad Joints

**Good joint:**
- Shiny appearance
- Smooth cone shape
- Solder flows onto both pad and lead

**Bad joint (cold joint):**
- Dull, grainy appearance
- Lumpy or irregular shape
- Poor connection

**Too much solder:**
- Large blob
- May bridge to adjacent pads

**Too little solder:**
- Pad not fully covered
- Weak connection

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Work from shortest to tallest** - Install low-profile components first
2. **Bend leads** - Bend component leads slightly to hold in place
3. **Don't overheat** - 2-3 seconds contact time maximum
4. **Clean the tip** - Wipe on damp sponge frequently
5. **Use flux** - Helps solder flow and prevents oxidation
6. **Take breaks** - Tired eyes make mistakes

## Desoldering

If you make a mistake:

1. **Solder wick** - Place over joint, heat with iron, absorbs solder
2. **Solder sucker** - Heat joint, place sucker, trigger to vacuum solder
3. **Add flux** - Makes desoldering easier
4. **Be patient** - May take several attempts

## Surface Mount (if applicable)

For SMD components:

1. **Use fine tip** - Smaller iron tip for precision
2. **Solder one pad first** - Tack one side, adjust alignment, solder other side
3. **Drag soldering** - For ICs, apply flux and drag across pins
4. **Use low heat** - SMD parts are more heat sensitive

## Safety

- **Ventilation** - Use fume extractor or work in ventilated area
- **Eye protection** - Safety glasses recommended
- **Hot iron** - Never touch tip, always use stand
- **Lead exposure** - Wash hands after soldering
- **Fire safety** - Keep flammable materials away

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Cold joints - Not enough heat
2. Solder bridges - Too much solder
3. Lifted pads - Too much heat or force
4. Wrong polarity - Check orientation before soldering
5. Rushing - Take your time!
